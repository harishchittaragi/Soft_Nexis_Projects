# Full Adder â€“ Verilog Project
This is my first basic project as part of my learning journey with Soft Nexis Technologies.
The project implements a 1-bit Full Adder using Verilog HDL and simulates it to verify the functionality.

**Project Details**
Tool Used: Xilinx Vivado
Language: Verilog
Simulation only.
**Description:**
Implements a 1-bit Full Adder with three inputs (A, B, Cin) and two outputs (Sum, Cout).
Designed, synthesized, and simulated using Vivado to validate correct logic operation.
Useful as a fundamental building block for larger arithmetic circuits.

**Learning Outcome**
Understanding of combinational logic design.
Hands-on experience with writing and simulating Verilog code in Vivado.
Familiarity with testbench creation for verifying design functionality.
